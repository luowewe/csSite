* Back to school

** Goal of course

## fragments

Learning to program.

More about what that means in a minute.

Will touch a bit on some issues beyond the purely technical such as various
ethical questions that come up in the field.

Prepare kids for subsequent CS courses that BHS offers: AP CSP, AP CS A, and IB CS.

** A bit about my background

## fragments

I worked in industry for almost three decades.

I wrote a few books.

I volunteered last year in almost all the CS classes except, ironically, this one.

This is my first year teaching high school.

* Programming

These are from what I told the kids

** What is programming?

## fragments

A language.

A form of problem solving.

An exercise in picking problems to solve.

##.

** Javascript

## fragments

The language of the web.

It’s incredibly popular and widely used.

It’s a real language. Thus it has warts and oddities.

But it has a clean core.

##.

** Why is programming fun?

## fragments

If you like creating things.

If you like solving puzzles.

If you like understanding how things work.

##.

** Why is programming hard?

## fragments

There are a lot of details that you have to get right.

It can be very abstract.

Those two things are usually at the opposite end of the mental spectrum.

##.

** What can you do when you know how to program?

## fragments

Understand, at least a bit, how all this stuff around us works.

Build tools to make your life better.

##.

* Finally

** If you're not stuck, you're not programming.

## fragments

Expect to be stuck.

When you get unstuck is when you learn the most.

##.

** How your kiddo can succeed in this class

## fragments

Program. Program. Program.

The only way to learn programming is to do it.

In some ways this is like an art class.

Get stuck. Get unstuck. Repeat.

##.

** How you can support them

## fragments

Remind them that it’s normal to be stuck.

Encourage them to ask for help.
