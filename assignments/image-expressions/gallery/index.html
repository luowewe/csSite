<p>
  Below are some images to give you practice with using numerical expressions.
</p>

<p>
  Your goal is to write code that draws each of images below in the
  the <a href="/assignments/image-expressions">image-expressions</a>
  environment. Pay attention to the descriptions of the position and size of the
  figures.
</p>

<p>
  This page will explain each image separately but eventually you should produce
  the image at the bottom of this page with all the figures in it.
</p>

<h2>Centered circle</h2>

<p>
  A filled blue circle centered horizontally and vertically in the drawing area
  with radius 50.
</p>

<h2>Red rectangle</h2>

<p>
  A red rectangle whose width is half the width of the drawing area and whose
  height is 100, centered on the x-axis and whose top is 50 pixels from the top
  of the drawing area.
</p>

<h2>Connected circles</h2>

<p>
  Two blue circles of radius 30. The first is 55 pixels to the right of the left
  side of the drawing area and 50 up from the bottom. The second is 70 pixels
  from the right side of the drawing area and 150 from the bottom. Their centers
  are connected by a black line.

<h2>Triangle in rectangle</h2>
