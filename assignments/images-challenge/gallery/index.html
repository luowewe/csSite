  Below are some images to give you a workout using loops and if statements.
</p>

<p>
  Your goal is to write functions in
  the <a href="/assignments/images-challenge">images-challenge</a> environment
  that create something like each of these images. However do not simply write a
  bunch of calls to drawing functions like <code>drawFilledCircle</code>. Your
  functions should contain only one call to any given drawing function in the
  body of a loop that does the rest of the work.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing you should do (and which I will be looking for when I review
  your code) is to develop your code incrementally. Write a simple version of
  the function that does some part of what you need and then build from there.
  Or if you <i>can</i> write the function all in one go on your first try, then
  try to simplify or otherwise improve your code.
</p>

<p>
  A couple functions that might come in handy are a few more
  from <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">Math</a></code>.
  <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor">Math.floor</a></code>
  takes a single numeric argument and returns the value rounded down to the
  nearest whole number.
  And <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">Math.random</a></code>
  takes no arguments and returns a random number (pseudo-random, technically)
  between 0, inclusive, and 1, exclusive.
</p>

<h2>Line of circles</h2>

<p>
  The function should take a single argument that allows the caller to specify
  the size of the circles drawn. It should then draw as many as fit across the
  width of the canvas.
</p>

<p><img src="/img/gallery/line-of-circles.png"></p>

<h2>Line of circles, alternating</h2>

<p>
  Like the previous function, this function should take a single argument that
  allows the caller to specify the size of the circles drawn. It should then
  draw as many as fit across the width of the canvas, alternating between two
  colors.
</p>

<h2>Concentric circles</h2>

<p>
  The function should take a single argument that specifies how many concentric
  circles to draw. It should then draw the largest circle to just fit in the
  canvas and the rest evenly spaced.
</p>

<p><img src="/img/gallery/concentric-circles.png"></p>

<h2>Checker board</h2>

<p>
  The function should take a single argument, `n`, that specifies the number of
  squares on each side of a checkeboard and should draw an n-by-n checker board.
</p>

<p><img src="/img/gallery/checkerboard.png"></p>

<h2>Not really curved</h2>

<p>
  The function should take a single argument that specifies the number of lines
  to draw.
</p>

<p><img src="/img/gallery/thingy.png"></p>

<h2>Fill with circles</h2>

<p>
  The function should take a single argument that specifies the size of the
  circles and should then fill the canvas with as many as fit.
</p>

<img src="/img/gallery/fill-with-circles.png">

<h2>Fill with circles randomly filled</h2>

<p>
  The function should take two arguments: the first specifies the size of the
  circles and the second the probability that any given circle is drawn filled
  in. For instance this image was creted with a circle radius of 17 and a
  probability of 0.23. You will need to use the
  function <code>Math.random()</code> which returns a random number from 0.0 to
  just below 1.0 each time it is called.
</p>

<h2>Square of circles</h2>
<p>
  The function should take a single argument that specifies the size of the
  circles and should then draw the square made up of circles of that size.
</p>
