<p>
  The goal of this exercise is to write functions in the editor to the left that
  pass test cases for the functions shown below. Whenever you are ready to run
  the tests, hit the <svg class="bi
  run-code"><use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#play-btn-fill"/></svg>
  button above the editor. To see the specification for a function you are
  supposed to write, click a button in the test panel. (You will need to click
  the <svg class="bi
  itp-run-code"><use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#play-btn-fill"/></svg>
  once first.) Once you have written the function with the right name, the
  button will indicate whether the test cases are all passing (green, with a ‚úÖ)
  or some are failing (red, with an ‚ùå) and clicking the button will show the
  results of the individual test cases.

  üö® <b>New material alert</b> üö®Some of these functions will be much
  easier (even trivial) to write if you use the <code>indexOf</code> method
  that exists on strings. It takes a single argument, which should be a
  string, and returns the index in the string on which it was called of the
  first occurrence of the argument string or -1 if it is not found. For
  instance if <code>s</code> is our old standby <code>"foobar"</code>
  then <code>s.indexOf("bar")</code> is <code>3</code>.

<div data-name="findFnord">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns the index of the first occurrence
    of 'fnord' in the string or -1 if there is no such occurrence.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="stringContains">
  <p>
    A function that takes two string arguments and returns a boolean indicating
    whether the first argument contains the second, i.e. is the second string a
    substring of the first string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="firstAndLast">
  <p>
    A function that takes a single string argument (which will be at least two
    characters long) and returns a string consisting of just the first and last
    characters of the string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="swapFrontAndBack">
  <p>
    A function that takes a single string argument and returns a string
    consisting of the second half of the original string followed by the first
    half. If the string is an odd number of characters it should include the
    extra charcater in the (original) front half.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="simplePigLatin">
  <p>
    A function that takes two arguments, a string containing a single word and a
    number indicating the index of the first vowel in the word, and returns the
    word translated into Pig Latin according to the simple rule of always adding
    'ay'
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="isAllUpperCase">
  <p>
    A function that that takes a single string argument and returns a boolean
    indicating whether the string is all upper case.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="sameIgnoringCase">
  <p>
    A function that takes two string arguments and returns a boolean indicating
    whether they are the same string if you ignore case differences.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="firstHalf">
  <p>
    A function that that takes a single string argument and returns the first
    half of the string. If the string has an odd number of characters the first
    half should be the shorter of the two parts.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="secondHalf">
  <p>
    A function that that takes a single string argument and returns the second
    half of the string. If the string has an odd number of characters it the
    second half should be the longer of the two parts.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="upDown">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns a string consisting of the
    original string in all uppercase followed by the original string in all
    lower case.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="everyOther">
  <p>
    A function that takes a single string, which will be at least five
    characters long, and returns a string consisting of the first, third, and
    fifth characters.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="upDownLastCharacter">
  <p>
    A function that takes a single string and returns a string consisting of the

<div data-name="firstName">
  <p>
    A function that given a string containing a full name consisting of a first
    name, a space, and a last name returns the first name. (Note, actual names
    are way more complicated than that. Almost nothing you think is true about
    names is likely actually true.)
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="lastName">
  <p>
    A function that given a string containing a full name consisting of a first
    name, a space, and a last name returns the last name. (Note, actual names
    are way more complicated than that. Almost nothing you think is true about
    names is likely actually true.)
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="concatenate">
  <p>
    A function that takes two strings and returns a string consisting of the two
    strings concatenated (smooshed together).
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="firstCharacter">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string argument and returns the first character of
    the string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="lastCharacter">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns the last character of the string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="allButFirst">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns a string consisting of all but
    the first character of the original string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="firstThree">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string that is at least three characters long and
    returns a string consisting of the first three characters of teh original
    string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="allButFirstAndList">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns a string consisting of all but
    the first and last characters of the original string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="lastThree">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string that is at least three characters long and
    returns a string consisting of the last three characters of the original
    string.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="capitalize">
  <p>
    A function that takes a string and returns a capitalized version of the
    string (first character in upper case and remaining characters in lower
    case).
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="capitalizeFirstThree">
  <p>
