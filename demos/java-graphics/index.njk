  <p>
    Unlike the Java Canvas demo, this environment gives you access to the
    full <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html">java.awt.Graphics</a></code>
    API. Your codeâ€™s <code>draw</code> method will be called with
    a <code>Graphic</code> object, a width, and a height and can use any of the
    methods on the <code>Graphic</code> object to draw an image. The image will
    be generated and returned to this webpage and displayed on the right. You
    should use the width and height arguments to make your code resilliant in
    the face of changing window sizes.
