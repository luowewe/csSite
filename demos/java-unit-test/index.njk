title: Java unit test assignment
---
{% extends 'jobe-testcases.njk' %}

<p>
  This is a demo of a jobe-based Java unit test assignment. The tests are
  specified in a JSON config file and with a file containing a Java reference
  implementation of the methods to be tested. The student code is submitted to
  the jobe server which then runs the test cases specified in the config files
  against both the student code and the reference implementation and returns
  results based on whether they agree.

<div data-name="add">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="subtract">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns their difference.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="multiply">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns their product.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="divide">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns their quotient.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can assume the second argument (the divisor) is not 0.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="mod">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns the remainder after dividing
    the first by the second.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can assume the second argument (the divisor) is not 0.
  </p>

<div data-name="averageOfTwo">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns their average.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="averageOfThree">
  <p>
    A function that takes three numbers and returns their average.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="distance">
  <p>
    A function that takes two numbers and returns how far apart they are on the
    number line.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="manhattanDistance">
  <p>
    A function that takes four numbers representing two points in the X/Y plane
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) and returns how far apart they are according to Manhattan
    distance (i.e. the sum of their distance on the x-axis and their distance on
    the y-axis.
  </p>
</div>

<div data-name="euclideanDistance">
  <p>
    A function that takes four numbers representing two points in the X/Y plane
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) and returns how far apart they are according to Euclidian
    distance (i.e. the square root of the sum of their squares of both the
    distance on the x-axis and the y-axis.
  </p>
