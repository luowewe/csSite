<div class="expression" data-expression="a + b">
  <h1>Sum</h1>
  <p>
    The sum of two numbers is what you get when you add them together. Write an
    expression for the sum of the two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a - b">
  <h1>Difference</h1>
  <p>
    The difference between two numbers is what you get when you subtract the
    second from the first. Write an expression for the difference between the
    two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a * b">
  <h1>Product</h1>
  <p>
    The product of two numbers is what you get when you multiply them. Write an
    expression for the product of the two numbers <code>a</code>
    and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a / b">
  <h1>Ratio</h1>
  <p>
    The ratio between two numbers is what you get when you divide the first by
    the second. Write an expression for the ratio of the two
    numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a % b">
  <h1>Remainder</h1>
  <p>
    The remainder of of dividing one number by another is the integer part left
    over after doing a division. Write an expression for the reminder after
    dividing <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="(a + b) / 2">
  <h1>Average</h1>
  <p>
    The average of two numbers is their sum divided by two. Write an expression
    for the average of the two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="expression" data-expression="(a + b + c) / 3">
  <h1>Average of three</h1>
  <p>
    The average of three numbers is their sum divided by three. Write an
    expression for the average of the numbers <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
    and <code>c</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="total / count">
  <h1>General average</h1>
  <p>
    The average of an arbitrary number of numbers is their total divided the
    number of numbers. Write expression for the average of a set
    of <code>count</code> numbers whose total is <code>total</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="a:number,b:number" data-expression="Math.abs(a - b)">
  <h1>Distance</h1>
  <p>
    The distance between two numbers (e.g. on the number line) is the absolute
    value of their difference. The <code>Math.abs</code> function returns the
    absolute value of its argument. Write an expression that computes the
    distance between two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="x1:number,y1:number,x2:number,y2:number" data-expression="Math.abs(x1 - x2) + Math.abs(y1 - y2)">
  <h1>Manhattan distance</h1>
  <p>
    The “Manhattan distance” between two points in 2d space is the sum of the
    distance between the points along the x axis (crosstown) and the distance
    between the points along the y axis (uptown/downtown). Write an expression
    that computes the Manhattan distance between two points the first whose x,y
    coordinates are given by the numbers <code>x1</code> and <code>y1</code> and
    the second by the numbers <code>x2</code> and <code>y2</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="x1:number,y1:number,x2:number,y2:number"
     data-expression="Math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)">
  <h1>2D distance</h1>
  <p>
    The normal way we measure the distance between points in 2d space is called
    Euclidian distance and is computed as the square root of the sum of the
    squares of the distance along the x and y axes. Write an expression that
    computes the Euclidian distance between two points the first whose x,y
    coordinates are given by the numbers <code>x1</code> and <code>y1</code> and
    the second by the numbers <code>x2</code> and <code>y2</code>. You can use
    the function <code>Math.sqrt</code> to compute the square root of a number,
    e.g. <code>Math.sqrt(4)</code> ⟹ <code>2</code>.
