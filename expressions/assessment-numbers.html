<div class="expression" data-expression="1337 * 32">
  <h1>1337 times 32</h1>
  <p>
    Write any expression that evaluates to the same thing as the product of 1337 and 32
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="6432 - 4000">
  <h1>Sally's even more apples</h1>
  <p>
    Sally had six thousand, four hundred and thirty two apples and she give four
    thousand and to Billy. Write an expression for the number of apples Sally
    has now.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="" data-expression="Math.PI * 4">
  <h1>Area of circle with radius 2</h1>
  <p>
    Write any expression that evaluates to the area of a circle with radius two.
    (Recall that the formula for the area of a circle is π times the square of
    the circle's radius.) You can use <code>Math.PI</code> to get a good
    approximation of π.</p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="24 * 60 * 60">
  <h1>Seconds in a day</h1>
  <p>
    Write any expression that evaluates to the number of seconds in a day.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a + b">
  <h1>Sum</h1>
  <p>
    The sum of two numbers is what you get when you add them together. Write an
    expression for the sum of the two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a - b">
  <h1>Difference</h1>
  <p>
    The difference between two numbers is what you get when you subtract the
    second from the first. Write an expression for the difference between the
    two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a * b">
  <h1>Product</h1>
  <p>
    The product of two numbers is what you get when you multiply them. Write an
    expression for the product of the two numbers <code>a</code>
    and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a / b">
  <h1>Ratio</h1>
  <p>
    The ratio between two numbers is what you get when you divide the first by
    the second. Write an expression for the ratio of the two
    numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="a % b">
  <h1>Remainder</h1>
  <p>
    The remainder of of dividing one number by another is the integer part left
    over after doing a division. Write an expression for the reminder after
    dividing <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-expression="(a + b) / 2">
  <h1>Average</h1>
  <p>
    The average of two numbers is their sum divided by two. Write an expression
    for the average of the two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="a:number,b:number" data-expression="Math.abs(a - b)">
  <h1>Distance</h1>
  <p>
    The distance between two numbers (e.g. on the number line) is the absolute
    value of their difference. The <code>Math.abs</code> function returns the
    absolute value of its argument. Write an expression that computes the
    distance between two numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="expression" data-variables="x1:number,y1:number,x2:number,y2:number" data-expression="Math.abs(x1 - x2) + Math.abs(y1 - y2)">
  <h1>Manhattan distance</h1>
  <p>
    The “Manhattan distance” between two points in 2d space is the sum of the
    distance between the points along the x axis (crosstown) and the distance
    between the points along the y axis (uptown/downtown). Write an expression
    that computes the Manhattan distance between two points the first whose x,y
    coordinates are given by the numbers <code>x1</code> and <code>y1</code> and
    the second by the numbers <code>x2</code> and <code>y2</code>.
  </p>
</div>
