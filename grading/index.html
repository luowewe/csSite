<p>
  You will be graded on a number of <a href="/standards/">standards</a>, each of
  which represents mastery of some aspect of what we are learning this year,
  e.g. <a href="/standards/#writing-basic-functions">Writing basic function</a>,
  <a href="/standards/#basic-control-constructs">Basic control constructs</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
  You will receive a grade on a scale from 0-4 for each standard where the
  points indicate how well you have demonstrated you understand the underlying
  material.
</p>

<table class="grade-standards">
  <thead>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Exceeding standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Meeting standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Approaching standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Beginning standard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Insufficient evidence</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  At any given point in the year your overall grade will be determined by
  averaging your grades on the standards we have covered at that point during
  the year. I may weight different standards differently throughout the year,
  usually to give more weight to standards that we have spent more time on. But
  by the end of the year your final grade will be based on how well you have
  mastered all the standards. However the mapping from the four-point scale to
  letters is more generous than the traditional mapping from percentages to
  letter grades:

  <thead>
    <th>Average on<br> 4-point scale</th>
    <th>As a %</th>
    <th>Letter grade</th>

      <td>B</td>

<h2>Knowledge standards and assessments</h2>

<p>
  In this grading system, assessments are truly that, an opportunity to assess
  how well you understand the material covered by a standard. They are just one
  way to provide evidence, both to me and to yourself, that you understand the
  material. If you do badly on an assessment that just means you don’t
  understand the material <i>yet</i> and you will have more opportunities to
  demonstrate that you have picked it up. A better performance on a later
  assessment or simply demonstrating understanding when you write code in our
  larger projects will raise your grade to whatever level of mastery you
  exhibit.
</p>

<h2>Habits of work standards</h2>

<p>
  Some of the standards I will be grading are not about particular knowledge but
  about how you work. For instance, what do you do when you are stuck? Do you
  break the problem down into smaller parts and figure out how to tackle them in
  pieces? Just like learning the syntax of the programming language, learning
  these habits is also a process and I will be keeping track of how often you
  demonstrate them over the semester. The more frequently you exhibit the
  habits, the higher your score will be on those standards.
</p>

<h2>Questions you might have</h2>

<h3>Q. How do assessments affect my grade?</h3>

<p>
  Assessments will test your understanding of material covered by one or more of
  the grading standards. For instance, an assessment that asks you to write
  functions involving numeric expressions would provide evidence of how well you
  understand both the basics of writing functions and using numeric expressions.
</p>

<p>
  How well you do on the different part of the assessment will be incorporated
  into your grade on the relevant standards with more recent information being
  weighted more heavily than older information.
</p>

<h3>Q. What else affects my grade?</h3>

<p>
  You can also provide evidence of understanding different material in ways
  other than taking assessments. The main one is by writing code—particularly on
  larger projects—that demonstrates your understanding. For instance, if you
  write your code that demonstrates you know how to write functions, I will
  adjust your grade on
  the <a href="http://localhost:8080/standards/#writing-basic-functions">Writing
  basic functions</a> standard to reflect that, regardless of how you have done
  on any assessment.
</p>

<h3>Q. Can my grade on a standard go down?</h3>

<p>
  It is possible. For instance, if you achieved a high score on an early
  assessment via cramming but didn’t really lock in your understanding of the
  material, your later work might show that and I would lower your grade on that
  standard until you could demonstrate that you had mastered the material.
  However almost everything we learn will build on what we’ve learned before so
  you will naturally have to use and review earlier material, so in practice
  grades should rarely go down.
</p>

<h3>Q. How can I improve my course grade?</h3>

<p>
  You can always improve your grade (unless you have 4s on all the standards!)
  by doing work that demonstrates an improved understanding of the material for
  any standard or by exhibiting the behaviors assessed by the habits of work
  standards. I will point out when a particular assignment or project provides
  opportunities to demonstrate understanding of particular standards.
</p>

<h3>Q. Okay, but what about extra credit?</h3>

<p>
  Since your grades are based on your understanding and habits, and since you
  can almost always improve your score on any standard, there isn’t really such
  a thing as <i>extra</i> credit.
</p>

<p>
  However, the one habit that I care about more than anything else is an
  inquisitive attitude about trying things in your programs, figuring out how
  things work, and generally pushing beyond your comfort zone. The best way to
  show that you really want to excel in this class is to frequently demonstrate
  that habit.
</p>

<p>
  I will happily answer any questions that come up and can always suggest things
  for you to try, but learning to program is about learning to learn: whatever
  specific language or technology you learn today will likely be out of date in
  a few years but if you have learned to learn you will easily be able to pick
  up the next thing.
