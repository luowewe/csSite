  Welcome to Berkeley Highâ€™s <i>{{ metadata.title }}</i> class.
</p>

<p>
  This website is your main jumping off point for material related to this
  class. I will usually also link to whatever we are working on in a given day
  from Google Classroom but this site will grow over the course of the year with
  new material so you should be familiar with what is here.
</p>

<h1>Table of contents</h1>

<h1><a name="">Setup</a></h1>

<p>
  The first thing you need to do is get set up with GitHub. To do that, go to
  the <a href="https://bhs-cs.gigamonkeys.com/">BHS CS</a> site and follow the
  instructions there about creating a GitHub account and then getting set up on
  that website. We'll be going over this in class in our first few days.
</p>


<h1><a name="">Class calendar</a></h1>

<p>
  For an overview of what we'll be covering this year take a look at
  our <a href="calendar/">class calendar</a>. This is a rough guide; we will
  make adjustments throughout the year as we see which topics need a bit more or
  less time.
</p>

<h1><a name="">Grading</a></h1>

<p>
  I used standards based grading which is a <a href="/grading/">grading
  system</a> where your grade is based entirely on your mastery of a number
  of <a href="/standards/">standards</a>. You should read these standards to
  understand what mastery of the material looks like. (Note, your grade at any
  point in the year will only depend on the standards that we have covered so
  far.)
</p>

<h1><a name="">Class policies</a></h1>

<p>
  Nothing too onerous but please read my <a href="/policies/">classroom
  policies</a>.
</p>

<h1><a name="">Slides</a></h1>

<ul>
  {% for deck in collections.slides %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ deck.url }}">{{ deck.data.title }}</a>
      <span class="slides-date">{{ deck.data.date | date('yyyymmdd') }}</span>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
