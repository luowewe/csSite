** Expression 2

##.

** True mod

To compute the true mathematical mod of `a` and `b` (what `a % b` would be if
`%` was true mod rather than remainder) you can compute the remainder of `a`
divided by `b`, add `b` to that, and then and take the remainder of that whole
thing when divided by `b`. Write an expression that implements that formula in
Java using `a` and `b` as the two operands.

##.

** Mental evaluation

What is \code{x} after the following code runs:

   int x = 0;
   x += 1;
   x -= 10;
   x *= -3;
   x %= 5;
   x = x * 2;
   x—-;

## freeanswer

##.

** Expansion

Same code as before except we don’t know the initial value of \code{x}. This
time write out a single expression that expresses the final result in terms of
\code{x}.

   x += 1;
   x -= 10;
   x *= -3;
   x %= 5;
   x = x * 2;
   x—-;
