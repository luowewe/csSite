// This is an example of a function definition. This function is called by the

// drawing exercise to draw shapes. The argument to this function, time, is the
// number of milliseconds (one millionth of a second) since the program started.

// of drawFrame either here or where it is defined. (Or, if you must, change it
// the same way in both places.)
