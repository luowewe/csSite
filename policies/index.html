<h2>Social basics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Please read and observe the Recurse
    Center's <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">Social rules</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    All phones must be turned in at the start of class. First-come, first-served
    access to the ten-slot Phone Spa and all other phones must go into the
    36-pocket Phone Jail. This is going to be a fast-paced class and you need to
    spend your time in class focused on what we are doing.
  </li>

  <li>
    Similarly, the computers are for programming and research related to your
    work. Don’t play games, don’t go on social media, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Very little to none as long as you use your time wisely during class.
  </li>

  <li>
    You are of course free to work on your projects outside of class but it
    should not be necessary to keep up.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding, open source, working together, and AI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write your own code.
  </li>

  <li>
    But definitely do talk to your peers about your code and theirs.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you find useful snippets of code on the internet, cite it in a comment
    with a link to where you found it.
  </li>

  <li>
    While generative AI is already a powerful tool for programmers, you are here
    to learn to program yourself. There may be assignments where I allow or even
    encourage you to use AIs like ChatGPT, but unless I specifically say that
    you may, you may not use AIs to do work for this class.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No food or drink near computers. (Water bottles okay.)</li>
</ul>
